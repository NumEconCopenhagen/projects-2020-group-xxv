# Data analysis project

Our project is both about and titled **Businesscycles and persistence in national account identities**. We start by using an interactive world map to introduce business cycles. Then we analyze the persistency of shocks in the National Account Identities variables.   

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We primarily use data from DST (Danmarks Statistik), the Federal Reserve and the World Data Bank, which we load through API's.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:
Bokeh - can be installed with "conda install bokeh"
Geopanda - can be installed with "conda install geopandas"
