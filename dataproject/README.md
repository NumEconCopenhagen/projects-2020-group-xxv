# Data analysis project

Our project is both about and titled **Buisnesscycles and persistence in national account identities** 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We primarily use data from DST (Danmarks Statistik), the Federal Reserve and the World Data Bank

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:
"conda install bokeh"
"conda install geopandas"
