# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **The Solow-model with fossil fuels and climate externalities**. In this project we'll solve and simulate the Solow model with fossil fuels with and without climate externalities and compare the results.


The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb). We have defined the model in modelproject.py.


**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
